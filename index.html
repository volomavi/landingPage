        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I've spent a long time thinking about, and drawing the perfect
          keyboard layout. Much more time than I'd admit to in casual
          conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web has become the final frontier of people interfacing with
          technology, from everything being a web app, to connecting with anyone
          on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like jogging through parks, co-op video games, spicy food, and have
          opinions about the oxford comma.
